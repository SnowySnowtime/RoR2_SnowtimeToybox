HIFU Turret - [WHITE/PINK, REFER TO PICTURE SENT IN DM, PORTAL TURRET WITH HEART]
uhh maybe let them charm nearby enemies, making them invincible and bringing them in with its beam/stunning them, then converting them into allies with some damage boost, with tangibility but without health decay
and then make those allies minions of it and give them the leash component/item so they tp around the turret
like a funnier happiest mask
cooldown probably at least 30s? wouldn't work on bosses or final bosses
