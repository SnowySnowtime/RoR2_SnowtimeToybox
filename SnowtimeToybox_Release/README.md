# Friendly Turrets!
- Still a work in progress, but:
- A purchaseable singleton walking turret with (eventually) a little bit of personality, inspired by the Best Buddy from Alloyed Collective.
- Every stage, a random Friendly Turret is selected. Can you find and help them?
- You are only allowed to have one type of Friendly Turret per player.

## Implemented Friendly Turrets:
- borbo turret borbo turret [2R4R](https://thunderstore.io/package/RiskOfBrainrot/2R4R/)
